# Design Pillars : Part 2
## From Inspiration To Structure

## Pillar 1: Risk-Reward Turn-Based Combat
The combat is about taking risks. Less risky options are generally less effective. Later challenges will require you to take risks. Risk-mitigation is minimized in the design. Mitigation is generally in the form of defenses, such as healing or damage reduction or dodge. Mitigation is either limited in use, minimal value, or comes at a cost. The turn-based structure gives you time to plan your turn and weigh your decisions carefully.

## Pillar 2: Deterministic Luck
All luck in the game is deterministic. reducing the punishment of randomness by making use of 1-in-X system. Rolling six dice and getting three 1's, two 2's, and a 4. Instead the system ensures that you get one of each result. This luck system is used for everything from loot to critical hits to damage ranges.

## Pillar 3: Synergy Between Character Options
Creative play between powers and the order they are used synergize with each other. Character options such as loot, powers, and archetypes can combine in different ways. Chaining together actions are rewarding. When designing options, they aren't balanced within the scope of an archetype or the wider system, which opens it up to builds that might be a little out-of-hand. Which is great! Finding the right combination of powers can be rewarding, especially if it feels like you broke the game. The challenge is making it feel like no option is useless. Each option should have a trade-off, whether it be investment in an archetype or the option itself having drawbacks.

## Pillar 4: Builds Defined By Choices, Not Loot
Loot accounts for 25% of your character's overall power. Everything else is determined by your character build.

## Pillar 5: Every Effect Is Dynamic and Based In Narrative
The goal is to avoid effects that are '+X damage' or '+X% resistance'. Every effect should feel more dynamic, such as '+X damage when something occurs' or '+X% resistance against specific effects'. Effects should also be based in narrative. What is the effect? Is it a flaming aura? An infusion of energy in a weapon? A shield of energy? Every effect starts with fluff and the mechanics are based on that description.

## Pillar 6: Simplified Math
You might have played RPG's where numbers reach hundreds or thousands or millions. Even RPG's that don't reach this amount can have complicated calculators weighed down by a dizzying number of factors. Often, the point of this is to look impressive, but it can make doing on-the-fly math complicated or impossible. One of this game's goals is to present the math in a way that is readable and that players can immediately understand the full impact (and consequences) of their actions. If information is missing, it will be done for tactical or strategic purposes - that's for you to piece together so that you can make the best choices possible.

## Pillar 7: Anime-Inspired Visuals With Surreal, Gothic Aesthetic
Flashy anime-inspired visuals mix with a chimera of H.R. Giger, John Martin, and Marc Silvestri to create a unique, stylized world. 

## Pillar 8: Epic Emotional Story, Told As A Visual Novel
The story is told through a visual novel format. It is focused on the personal struggles of Lucifer, Noctis, and the fallen angels in the midst of an epic conflict between Heaven and Hell.
