## Early Mechanical Concepts
These early concepts are ideas for mechanics I've come up with to satisfy six of the eight design pillars. Since the last two are artistic, they'll be out of scope for this article, but I'll definitely be writing future articles to cover them more in-depth.

### Character Building
When deciding on a system for character-building, I researched a dizzying number of skill trees and character creation systems. And dang, are there are a lot of ways to make a character! As always, I like to over-think systems like these, so I've taken the time to break down what a character-building system is, why certain systems are designed the way they are, and what decisions I made in regards to Lucifer RPG.

#### What Are Character-Building Systems?
Character-building systems are progression systems that create characterization. I think what differentiates getting to the next level in Super Mario and spending a skill point in Diablo 2 is *characterization*. They're both progression systems, but everyone's Mario is the same (any difference depends on whose playing, not the progression system). In God Of War (2018), not everyone's Kratos is the same. He takes on a different character depending on what choices are made in his skill tree.

*Investment* is also an important element of character-building systems. This might be in the form of skill points, but it could also mean gear found through countless hours of grind. Since the early days of D&D, this meant gold to buy better equipment and experience points to earn levels. In Diablo 2, investment meant spending points in skills and attributes. 

#### Concept: Archetypes & Ranks
I settled on something simple and reminiscent of the inspiration's source material. There are four classes, currently called 'archetypes', that you can progress up by investing ranks. Ranks are earned by spending dark shards, which are earned each time you complete a dungeon for the first time. 

### Risk-Reward Combat
I knew that I wanted to create a system of ability/spell management that emphasized chaining together powers for powerful combos (Pillar 3), but added risk-reward gameplay into the mix (Pillar 1). I first considered a resource-based system where you need to ration your powers for when you really need them. But I felt that this made it to where you didn't use your powers enough, which wasn't conducive to creating synergistic chains. It also didn't push the player to find different chains of powers, since they have limited room to experiment with different powers. Last, it creates an experience where your choices end when you no longer have a resource. This can be frustrating for anyone who is familiar with most Final Fantasy games or card games, when you lack the resources to make any meaningful plays.

#### Concept: Backfire System
My answer to this was the 'backfire' system. Essentially, every power has a 'Backfire' chance using deterministic luck (Pillar 2), such as '1-in-3' or '1-in-5'. That 'chance score' determines when the power backfires, causing the player to lose a portion of their maximum health. This creates an interesting risk-reward dynamic. There isn't that severe of a risk in using the power; you can use a '1-in-3' power three times and you know it will only backfire once. The actual backfire effect is also intended to be only a small percentage of your maximum health, meaning you could backfire a couple of times before you need to start being careful. With limited healing during dungeons, any risks you take with powers grow as your health gets lower. This system also incentivizes you to 'count' your power uses, similar to counting cards in poker. You can make better decisions if you keep track of how many times you've used a power and how soon you expect a Backfire.
