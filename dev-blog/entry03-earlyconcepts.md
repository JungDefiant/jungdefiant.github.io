### The Backfire System
I knew that I wanted to create a system of managing powers that emphasized chaining together powers for powerful combos (Pillar 3), but added risk-reward gameplay into the mix (Pillar 1). I considered a resource-based system where you need to ration your powers for when you really need them. But I felt that this made it to where you didn't use your powers enough, which wasn't conducive to creating synergistic chains. It also didn't push the player to find different chains of powers, since they have limited room to experiment with different powers.

My answer to this was the 'backfire' system. Essentially, every power has a 'Backfire' chance using deterministic luck (Pillar 2), such as '1-in-3' or '1-in-5'. That chance determined when the power backfires, causing the player to lose a portion of their maximum health. This creates an interesting risk-reward dynamic. There isn't that severe of a risk in using the power - you can use a '1-in-3' power three times and you know it will only backfire once. The actual backfire effect is also small; you lose 5% of your maximum health, meaning you could backfire at least 5-10 times before you need to start being careful.
