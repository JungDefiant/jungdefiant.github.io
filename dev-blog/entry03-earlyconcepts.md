### The Backfire System
I knew that I wanted to create a system of ability/spell management that emphasized chaining together powers for powerful combos (Pillar 3), but added risk-reward gameplay into the mix (Pillar 1). I first considered a resource-based system where you need to ration your powers for when you really need them. But I felt that this made it to where you didn't use your powers enough, which wasn't conducive to creating synergistic chains. It also didn't push the player to find different chains of powers, since they have limited room to experiment with different powers. Last, it creates an experience where your choices end when you no longer have a resource. This can be frustrating for anyone who is familiar with most Final Fantasy games or card games, when you lack the resources to make any meaningful plays.

My answer to this was the 'backfire' system. Essentially, every power has a 'Backfire' chance using deterministic luck (Pillar 2), such as '1-in-3' or '1-in-5'. That 'chance score' determines when the power backfires, causing the player to lose a portion of their maximum health. This creates an interesting risk-reward dynamic. There isn't that severe of a risk in using the power; you can use a '1-in-3' power three times and you know it will only backfire once. The actual backfire effect is also intended to be only a small percentage of your maximum health, meaning you could backfire a couple of times before you need to start being careful. With limited healing during dungeons, any risks you take with powers grow as your health gets lower. This system also incentivizes you to 'count' your power uses, similar to counting cards in poker. You can make better decisions if you keep track of how many times you've used a power and how soon you expect a Backfire.
