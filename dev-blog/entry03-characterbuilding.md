## Early Concepts : Character-Building
When deciding on a system for character-building, I researched a dizzying number of skill trees and character creation systems. And dang, are there are a lot of ways to make a character! As always, I like to over-think systems like these, so I've taken the time to break down what a character-building system is, why certain systems are designed the way they are, and what decisions I made in regards to Lucifer RPG.

### What Are Character-Building Systems?
Character-building systems are progression systems that create characterization. I think what differentiates getting to the next level in Super Mario and spending a skill point in Diablo 2 is *characterization*. They're both progression systems, but everyone's Mario is the same (any difference depends on whose playing, not the system). In God Of War (2018), not everyone's Kratos is the same. He takes on a different character depending on what choices are made in his skill tree.

*Investment* is also an important element of character-building systems. This might be in the form of skill points, but it could also mean gear found through countless hours of grind. Since the early days of D&D, this meant gold to buy better equipment and experience points to earn levels. In Diablo 2 and every action RPG that came after it, investment meant spending points in skills and attributes.

*Choice* is not a part of every character-building system, but it's something I think most of these systems should strive for. Of course, this can be difficult to build into a game. More often than not, the designers won't leave any choice up to the players. There isn't anything wrong with this approach. Designers have spent years on WoW and LoL, but no amount of nerfs or buffs can make every character option viable. On the other side, you have systems like Pathfinder and D&D 3.5e. These games may attempt to maintain some illusion of balance, but there are so many options that the number of game-breaking builds are nearly endless. However, I think what D&D-inspired systems do well is having drawbacks for any choice you make. Typically, there's some investment or cost needed for power, especially spells. Most powerful builds require a lot of 'feat taxing' and meeting multi-class requirements. Even then, they usually have some weakness that can be exposed. 

The worst mistake that a character-building system can have is designing only one optimal choice. If everyone is taking an option, then that option either needs to be standard for everyone or it needs to be changed. An example of this occurring is the Fitness power pool in City Of Heroes. In the early days of the superhero MMO, the options in this pool were so valuable that almost everybody took them. You were below average if you didn't take almost all the options in this tree. Eventually, the devs made them standard for every character. This has always stuck in my mind as the wisest move that designers could make about an option like this.

### Concept: Archetypes & Ranks
Alright, so I have my ingredients for the *best character-building system ever*: characterization, investment, and choice. I'll start with characterization. I liked the idea of different skill trees that you could progress down. I came up with 'archetypes', which are framed as different aspects of Lucifer. The four archetypes include the Dragon, the Daystar, the Apollyon, and the Serpent. Each has their own specific playstyle and Lucifer's combat style will shift depending on which archetype(s) he's invested in. For example, the Dragon is Lucifer as an aggressive brute with high durability and savage weapon attacks. The Apollyon, on the other hand, is Lucifer as a magical destroyer who sacrifices survivability for massive power.

For investment, my plan for progressing up these skill trees is through a currency called *dark shards*. You earn dark shards by completing dungeons. Most of the dungeons are part of a main 'questline', but I also like the idea of 'challenge dungeons' that hand out extra dark shards. You spend these dark shards on ranks in archetypes. You can have up to 12 ranks overall, but you can spread out these ranks across up to three archetypes. There's a minimum investment of 4 ranks in an archetype before you can 'branch out' however, limiting many of the higher-level options to those who specialize. This grants the benefit of mixing-and-matching character options, but sacrificing access to more powerful abilities.

Last is choice. Every few ranks in an archetype will give you two to three options to choose from. You can only pick one of these options however. This gives a lot of diversity within a single archetype. It also allows me to balance options within the same rank and create strict 'power gates', where lower rank options are at a particular level of power. As for balancing options across archetypes or between higher and lower ranks of the same archetype, I'm strongly considering taking a 'hands-off' approach. This is for two reasons; 1) this opens the system up for experimentation without any artificial tweaking from the design side and 2) I'm a solo dev - that's way too heavy of a task for one person when I got other things to worry about.

In the next post, I'll be talking about the backfire system, which is how I'm adding risk-reward to the ability system.
