### Call stack / Understanding the JavaScript call stack
Javascript uses a call stack to process functions, meaning that each function is placed into an order to be processed and then those functions are executed in that order. Functions on the stack are executed in the order of LIFO, or last-in first-out. Essentially, the last function added to the stack is the first to be executed. If a function calls another function inside it, that function is added to the stack and then called before the container function. Stack overflow occurs when a function is called recursively without a way of exiting the loop, meaning the function is placed repeatedly on the stack until it has no more room.
