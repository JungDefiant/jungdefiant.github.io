## HTML & CSS
### Chapter 15: "Layouts"
Each element in HTML is either a block element or an inline element. The page flows from top to bottom with block-level elements stacked on top of each other and child elements nested inside containing parent elements. The positioning of HTML elements can be changed using relative positioning and absolute positioning. Other ways of changing the positioning of an element is through the *float*, *width*, and *margin* properties.
