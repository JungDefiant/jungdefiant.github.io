# Class 10 Notes

### Stacks and Queues
A stack is a data structure that follows the principle of LIFO (Last In, First Out). The structure is based on nodes that only have information about nodes that are next in the stack, but not before. When a new node is pushed to the stack, it is added on top of the stack and becomes the new top of the stack (Last In). When a node is popped (removed) from the stack, the top of the stack is removed and the next node in the stack becomes the top (First Out)

A queue is a data structure similar to a stack, except it operate on the principle of LILO (Last In, Last Out). In this case, nodes added to the queue via enqueue function will be added next to the rear node. However, when a node is removed (dequeue), the front node is removed, like in a stack.
