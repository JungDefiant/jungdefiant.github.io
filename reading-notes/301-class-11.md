### EJS Partials
EJS partials are a way of adding dynamic values into web pages. This is done by defining templates in .ejs files and injecting them via JS code. The standard notation is for dynamic data in an .ejs file is <%= value %>, where value is given by JS. HTML can also be modularized by separating code blocks into their own .ejs files and importing them via the <%- include() %> line.
