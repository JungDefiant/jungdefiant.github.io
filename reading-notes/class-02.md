### Chapter 2: "Basic Javascript Instructions"
- **Statement:** This is a single line or step in a JS program.
- **Code Block:** This is a block of statements enclosed in curly brackets { };
- **Comment:** This is a line intended for notes. It does not run in the program. Single-line comments begin with //. Multi-line comments are enclosed in /* */.
- **Variable:** This is a piece of data, stored by a pointer given a specific name. Data types for JS variables include numbers, strings, and booleans. Multiple variables can be declared and initialized on the same line. 
- **Arrays:** This is a variable that stores multiple variables in a list. There are two ways to create arrays: variableName = [,,,] and variableName = new Array {}. Values can be accessed by index. 
- **Expression:** This a statement that evaluates to a single value. They can be assigned to variables.
- **Operators:** These are characters with specific functions. There are different operators for conditional statements, arithmetic, and string building. 

### Chapter 4: "Decisions and Loops"
- **Decision Making:** Flowcharts can help visualize how a computer processes information. They branch out at *conditions*, which is a decision that the program evaluates in order to know which branch to take.
- **Conditions:** These are statements that evaluate whether a decision is true or false. They evaluate an expression and return true/false. Then statements follow the conditions that indicate what happens when a condition is met. Comparison (=, <, >) and logical operators (!, &&, ||) can be used to write the expressions to evaluate and multiple expressions can be compared.
