### Concepts of Functional Programming in Javascript
The idea of functional programming is to design immutable, self-contained operations that can't affect other parts of the system. Pure functions are functions that don't create any outside changes and always return the same value with the same parameters. Immutable objects are objects that don't change over time. Combining immutability and pure functions create referential transparency, or code that produces the same result with the same parameters. Using referential transparency, the return values of pure functions can be piped into other functions through chaining for more complex operations and without changing any values outside of the operation.

### Refactoring JavaScript for Performance and Readability (with Examples!)
When writing code, performance can be important, but not at the cost of readability. Some examples are given in the article.
- Instead of using an array of objects, using a hashmap avoids messy code to get specific elements from a data structure
- Functions with more complicated and heavy operations should have their parts broken into smaller functions
- When nesting for loops and using variables that utilize indices, store variables into smaller variables before each new for loop iteration to prevent convoluted variable references
