### Claims & JWT Tokens

ASP.NET uses claims-based authentication to verify users. This type of system uses a number of *claims*, which is data representing who the user is. An *identity* is a representation of several claims. When a server receives an identity, it checks its claims to see what resources it can access. ASP.NET also uses claims-based authorization by allowing developers to set policies based on an identity's claims. *JWT tokens* are a means of packaging claims in an encoded JSON to be sent to a web server. The tokens are encrypted with a hashed signature to protect it from "man-in-the-middle" attacks.
