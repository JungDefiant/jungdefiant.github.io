# Class 3 Notes

### File and Stream I/O
Files are data in the form of bits in stored memory. Streams are a 'stream' of bits that can be actively written to or read from. C# includes Readers and Writers for streams in its base libraries. It is recommended that any operations with streams are done asynchronously to prevent your program from becoming slow.

### Write Files
C# provides the StreamWriter class, which can be used to write text into files. This is done with the 'using' keyword and calling the WriteFile() method. This can also be done asynchronously using the WriteAsync() method. Alternatively, the File class can be used to append new lines to an existing file.

### Read Files
A new file can be written and read using the FileStream class. This class converts a file to a data stream, which can then be written to by a BinaryWriter or parsed using a BinaryReader.
