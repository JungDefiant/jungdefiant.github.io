# Class 07 Notes
## HTML & CSS
### Chapter 6: "Tables"
Tables can be added to HTML pages to represent complex data. The basic HTML tags for table include *table*, *tr*, *td*, and *th*. *table* encloses the whole table as a single block, *tr* indicates the start of a row, *td* indicates a cell entry in a row, and *th* is the heading for a row or column. 

## Javascript & JQuery
### Chapter 3: "Functions, Methods, and Objects"
Javascript defines new classes of objects using *new Object()* or simply defining a *constructor*. Properties can be added after the object is created or inside the constructor. A new instance of this object can be created by using the *new* keyword with the name of the object and assigning it to a variable. There are different objects that come pre-packaged with JS, each dedicated to a different model. One of them is the DOM, which refers to the document object and the HTML content that it holds.

### Domain Modeling
When designing a model of data using JS, it's important to identify the objects with similar properties. In the example given in the article, epic fail videos are all independent objects with the same properties. After identifying objects in this way, the designer can make a new constructor to represent that data. Encapsulating data in this way is referred to as the *object-oriented model*.
