### Claims & JWT Tokens

ASP.NET uses claims-based authentication to verify users. This type of system uses a number of *claims*, which is data representing who the user is. An *identity* is a representation of several claims and a user can be made up of multiple identities. When a user attempts an action on the server, it checks the user's claims to see what resources they can access. ASP.NET also uses claims-based authorization by allowing developers to set policies based on an identity's claims. *JWT tokens* are a means of packaging claims in an encoded JSON to be sent to a web server. The tokens are encrypted with a hashed signature to protect it from "man-in-the-middle" attacks.
