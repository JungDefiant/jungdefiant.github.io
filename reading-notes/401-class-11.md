# Class 11 Notes

### Database Schema
A database schema is a structure that shows how data is organized in a database. We use them to constrain and organize data added to a database. They often look like visual diagrams on the design-side, but each database technology has its own way of depicting database schemas.

### Database Keys
A primary key is an identifier for a value in a relational database. A foreign key is an identifier that links between two tables. A composite key is an identifier that combines more than one value reference to the same key. 

### Database Relationships
A one-to-one relationship is a relationship where one database record is only related to one other database record. A many-to-many relationship is a relationship where multiple records in a database is related to multiple records in another database. A one-to-many or many-to-one relationship is a relationship where a single record is related to multiple records from foreign tables.
