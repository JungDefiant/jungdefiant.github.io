# Class 33: OAUTH

OAuthorization is an authentication service which allows users to use their credentials from a particular service provider when logging into a website. The process is as follows: 
A client requests authorization --> The service provider authenticates and grants user permissions before redirecting to a URI --> The client requests a token --> The service provider grants an access token to the client --> The client stores the token. There are two endpoints when authenticating through a service provider: the authorization endpoint (/oauth/authorization) and the token endpoint (oauth/access_token). When setting up OAuth in an ASP.NET application, the client ID, client secret, authentication claims, and endpoints need to be specified for each provider. After authenticating, the user's claims are stored in the application's user store. Now whenever the user wants to retrieve information related to that service provider, they can use the claims stored on the web application's server side.
