# Class 42: Ethics

Due to the quick advancement of technology in the past century, society has been struggling to know how to use it properly. The information age is filled with the misuse of technology, from propaganda to malicious software to psychologically addicting apps. It is the responsibility of software engineers to know how to spot unethical coding practices and prevent technology from harming others.

In the workplace, it is possible that clients or companies request programmers to design unethical code. When such code fails or causes harm (even death), the engineers might be quickly blamed despite 'following orders'. Engineers are always responsible for the code they write and they should never overlook writing something that seems manipulative or suspicious. An example includes Bill Sorour's confession of writing a marketing quiz for a drug targeted at teen girls that causes severe depression and suicidal thoughts.

In technology, the use of AI and Big Data are currently major concerns in the industry. Facial recognition, offensive military projects, and self-driving cars all come with many uncomfortable and foreboding implications. How might a government use this technology for a surveillance state? How might the technology of self-driving cars be compromised and cause disasters? The collection of data is a major concern for the privacy of individuals, whose data is collected (often without their explicit consent) and sold to manipulate marketing practices. This might not be too serious until the data is used to guess your demographic and affect how someone is treated if they are a historically-oppressed minority.
