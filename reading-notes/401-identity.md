### Identity

In ASP.NET, a user is understood by the system in three classes: Claim, ClaimsIdentity, and ClaimsPrincipal. The Claim class identifies one piece of information about the user to verify their identity. The ClaimsIdentity class represents one form of identification for a user that contains several Claim objects. Lastly, the ClaimsPrincipal is the user itself and it's made up of multiple ClaimsIdentity objects. When a user signs into a web app, they pass a ClaimsPrincipal that is then sent to an AuthenticationHandler.

When a user attempts to access a restricted resource from a web server, they typically need to be authenticated first. This is done by first being passed through authenticated middleware, which is instantiated in the startup program from the server. The middleware figures out whether a user exists in the user store of the web server by calling on the authentication handler. An authentication handler is a component that performs five behaviors called *verbs*: Authenticate, Challenge, SignIn, SignOut, and Forbid. This means the authentication handler checks whether the user exists, prompts the user to log-in, manages log-in sessions, and prevents users from accessing resources that they don't have permission to.
