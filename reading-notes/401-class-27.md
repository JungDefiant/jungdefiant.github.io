# Class 27: Razor Pages

Razor Pages are similar to Razor views, except they can handle MVC actions without directly going through a controller and they display all data that a page needs in a *page model* (as opposed to a view model). They are also designed to separate the web server's functionality from how the information is displayed. The main components of a Razor Page are the *view file* with an *@page* at the top and the *page model*. The page model binds properties from a database context to specific values. Those properties can then be referenced in the view file. A page model is designed to decouple the view from the rest of the MVC through dependency injection. This also makes unit testing possible for page models and view files. There are other capabilities for Razor Pages that don't exist with view models, including multiple page handlers per page and custom routes. They also have more flexibility than controllers, since they can specify what data is 'view data' as well as 'temp data' (data that's only used once).
