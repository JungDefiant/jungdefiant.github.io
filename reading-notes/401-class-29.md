# Class 29 : Hash Tables

A hash table is a data structure made up of *buckets* (or *slots*) that contain values and associated with a *key*. The pairs between a bucket and key are associated using a deterministic *hashing algorithm*. The result of the algorithm is a *hash*, which determines where the key is stored. Anyone accessing the key can then access its associated value. When one or more keys are associated with the same index, this is called a *collision*. This often occurs due to a poor hashing algorithm. One way to resolve collisions is by created a Linked List in each bucket on the hash map. This way, multiple values can be stored to the same bucket and the same hash. Retrieving these values is done by finding the bucket associated with a key, then matching that key/value pair with an entry in the Linked List. A hash map can have multiple buckets and ideally hash maps have more buckets than entries. A smaller hash map experiences too many collisions, reducing its efficiency.
