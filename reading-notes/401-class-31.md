# Class 31: Sending Emails

Azure offers SendGrid as a cloud-based service for integrating email handling through .NET framework. To create an email, a SendGridMessage object can be instantiated. Sending an email is done by accessing the API key of your SendGrid account and creating a new client associated with that key. You can then call the client's SendEmail() method, passing in a SendGridMessage object. This process can be integrated into an MVC architecture using the MailHelper object to send emails to multiple recipients. An attachment can be sent by creating a new Attachment object with the raw content of the attachment converted to Base64. Then the AddAttachment() method is called on the SendGridMessage with the Attachment object passed in.
