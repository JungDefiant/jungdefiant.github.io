# Class 09 Notes
## HTML & CSS
### Chapter 7: "Forms"
Forms are entry fields on websites that take input from the user. For example, text input fields, radio buttons, drop-down menus, etc. In HTML, forms can be created using the *form* tag as a container element. Within that element, the designer can specify input using the *input* tag.

### Chapter 14: "Lists, Tables & Forms"
CSS allows for specific properties that can further customize lists, tables, and forms. For lists, the designer can customize how the bullet points appear and whether the bullet points are contained inside a block element. Tables can have the positioning of the cells, the appearance of the borders, the spacing between cells, the color of the table's background, etc. Forms can have their appearance customized through typical CSS properties with some more relevant to specific kinds of input than others.

## Javascript & JQuery
### Chapter 6: "Events"
A common type of code in many programming languages is events. Events have an *event listener* or an *event handler*, which determines what is called to *raise* (or *fire*) the event. Other functions are *subscribed* to the listener and they *trigger* when they event is raised. In addition to named functions, *anonymous functions* can be added to the parameter of an event listener. JS includes many pre-packaged events that are typically used.
