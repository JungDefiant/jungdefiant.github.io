# Class 05 Notes
## HTML & CSS
### Chapter 5: "Images"
Webpages use images instead of descriptions to more quickly engage users with the page. Several challenges need to be accounted for with images. Different formats are better for different uses. For example, a JPEG image is better for lots of different colors and details while a GIF/PNG is better for images with fewer colors or large areas of one color. A page might want to use vector images as opposed to raster images to ensure that the image doesn't lose quality at different sizes. The designer should also keep in mind how the image is displayed. CSS rules are recommended to align images properly. The alt and title tags enable the images to be understood by voice-to-text apps. The figure HTML tag can help with formatting an image with a caption.

### Chapter 11: "Color"
Color can be used to create effective webpages. Designers use contrast to help elements stick out when layered on top of each other. Some websites use more advanced options like opacity, but these can have trouble showing up in older browsers. Computers use red, green, and blue values to display color in each pixel on the screen. These values can be modified for text and backgrounds through the use of CSS styling. Other ways of modifying color n CSS3 include modifying hue, saturation, and lightness.

### Chapter 12: "Text"
There's a variety of ways to add text to a webpage. There are five families of fonts, including cursive, fantasy, serif, sans-serif, and monospace. Within these family of fonts are several kinds of fonts that you can use for a webpage. Choosing a unique font can bring a lot of style to a page, but it may not be available to a user's browser. In this case, a font stack is used to indicate which fonts should be used if one of them is not available. Text can also be included on a webpage through Flash or images. CSS offers a plethora of ways to modify fonts for unique displays.
