# Class 14 Notes

### Binary Trees
These are data structures made up of several nodes with left and/or right children. The top level node is the root and nodes at the bottom of the tree with no branching children are called leaves. 

### Binary Tree Traversal
There are two categories of binary tree traversal: Depth First and Breadth First.

**Depth First:** This prioritizes traversal through the height of the tree. There are three orders that a tree can be traversed: Pre-Order, In-Order, and Post-Order. 
**Breadth First:** This prioritizes traversal through each 'level' of the tree. Traversal starts at the root, then traverses to the root's children, and then traverses to those root's children until the bottom of the tree is reached.

### Binary Search Trees
Normally, binary trees have O(n) time complexity to traverse the tree for most tasks. In a BST, the tree is structured based on the values of the nodes. Since the tree is organized in this way, the value can be used to traverse the tree via logical operators. For example, if the lower values always go to the left of a parent node, then the tree can be traversed by iterating through the tree and comparing the value of each node traversed to a specific conditional case. Nodes that don't match the conditional case are never traversed, cutting down the time complexity of traversing the tree significantly. In the best case, this complexity becomes O(log n).
