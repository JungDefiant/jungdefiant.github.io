#Class 32: View Components

View components are like partial views that do not depend on model binding and only render the data given to it. These components are separate from the MVC architecture and they're typically only called within a view or by another method that is rendering to the view. The Invoke method is used to render a view component to the page. A view associated with the component is typically found in a Default.cshtml or a .cshtml file matching the name of the view component. To use a view component, define different view models for that component and then instantiate those models in the Invoke method, returning a View() with the view model passed in.
